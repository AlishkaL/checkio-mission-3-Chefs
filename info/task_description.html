    You are the owner of the cafe, where 3 chefs works: JapaneseCook, RussianCook and ItalianCook. Each of them can cook the national food and drink:<br>
- JapaneseCook: Sushi and Tea<br>
- RussianCook: Dumplings and Compote<br>
- ItalianCook: Pizza and Juice<br>
Your task is to create 3 different classes for each chef and methods for them:<br>
- add_food(food_amount, food_price), which add to the client's order value of the foods which he had chosen<br>
- add_drink(drink_amount, drink_price), which add to the client's order value of the drinks which he had chosen<br>
- total(), which return string like that: 'Foods: 150, Drinks: 50, Total: 200', and for the each chef instead of Foods and Drinks will be used him national food and drink.<br>
Every client can choose only one chef.
In this mission this design patter could help - <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern'>Abstract Factory</a>.

<p>
<strong>Example</strong>:
<pre class="example">
>>>client_1 = JapaneseCook()
>>>client_1.add_food(2, 20)
>>>client_1.add_drink(5, 4)
>>>client_1.total()
Sushi: 40, Tea: 20, Total: 60
</pre>

    <strong>Input: </strong>Statements and expression with the 3 chef's classes.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The behaviour as described.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Work with classes and object-oriented programming - is a high level which you should learn for using full benefits of Python.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    All data are correct.
